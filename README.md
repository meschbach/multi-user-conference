# multi-user-conference

Experimental test to improve remote conference and local meetup interactions.  Basic idea is provide segment spaces like
a real world building would.

This was original based on an article written about a gaming conference who went on-line in 2020.  They provided
concentric levels of interaction within any given room.  Starting with general chat within a whole room, a subgroup chat
for with those of interest, then allowing for voice chat and eventually video chat.  The biggest problem for me  was their
tight dependency on Azure.
